# New_user_training
Slides and files with useful tips and tricks for bash and python (created for new users in my Ph.D. lab)

"NAG_python_and_bioinformatics.pdf" contains a gentle introduction to python and its applications in bioinformatics created for new user training in the Hug Lab

"streamlined_useful_bash_commands" contains succinct bash commands to quickly process files as part of routine (bioinformatics) file processing. The downside to bash is that it isn't very human readable compared to some other programming languages, so reproducibility and sharing with others with limited bash knowledge becomes challenging. Use sparingly and with caution. 

"system_related_bash_commands" is more advanced, and many of the commands within it require superuser/su/sudo priveleges. This file helps troubleshoot system issues and clarify system architecture. Use with a lot of caution.
